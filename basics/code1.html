    <h1>Welcome to My Blog</h1>
    <p>
      Hi guys! Welcome to my blog, a digital sanctuary where I document my
      journey as a BCA student, share study insights, thoughts, and reflections.
      Join me on this journey of introspection.

    <h2>Some information about My Self</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I am <mark>Pulkit Dubey</mark>, a BCA student currently in my 6th semester. I am really interested
      in computers, especially web development and programming. Over the past
      few years, I have learned languages like C, C++, Java, Python, and
      JavaScript. I enjoy building small projects to improve my skills. I am
      always curious to learn new things and looking forward to building a
      career in the tech field.
